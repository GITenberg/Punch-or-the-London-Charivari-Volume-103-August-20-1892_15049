    <h3>ANTIQUITY OF GOLF.</h3>

    <p>That Golf was a game probably known to and played by
    pre-Adamite Man (whoever he may have been; name and address not
    given) is evidenced by the learned Canon TRISTRAM's observation
    in the Biology Section of the British Association Meeting last
    week, to the effect that "he (the Canon) had never seen a
    better collection of these Links connecting the present with
    the past world." This must be most interesting to all
    Golf-players.</p>

    <h2>RATHER APPROPRIATE.</h2>

    <p>Under the heading "Military Education," there appears in
    <i>The Tablet</i>, an advertisement concerning preparation for
    examinations at Woolwich and Sandhurst by "the Rev. E. VON
    ORSBACH, F.R.G.S., F.R.Hist.S., late Tutor to their Highnesses
    the Princes of THURN-AND-TAXIS." What a suggestive name for a
    tutor preparing young men for a Cavalry Regiment is "VON
    ORSBACH!" Not only would pupils surmount all difficulties of
    EUCLID's propositions, but being brought up by VON ORSBACH,
    they would dare all "riders!" Then as to the Princes, his
    pupils, cannot we conceive of the first Prince THURN how he has
    been turned out a perfect 'orseman by VON ORSBACH, and how it
    would tax all an Examiner's ingenuity to pluck TAXIS. Pity that
    when one Prince was called TAXIS the other wasn't named RATES.
    But evidently this was an oversight. A neat couplet might head
    this advertisement, and add to its attractiveness, as for
    instance:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Every question, whatever they ax is,</p>

            <p>Will in its THURN be answered by TAXIS.</p>

            <p>TAXIS and THURN, for a win you'll of course
            back,</p>

            <p>The pick of the stable, the trainer VON ORSBACH.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>We wish him a continuance of the successes which from his
    list this Equestrian Military Tutor&mdash;he can't he a "coach"
    as he is an ORSBACH&mdash;has already obtained. It's a German
    name, but it sounds more like 'Orsetrian (!)</p>
    <hr />

    <p>CUI BONO?&mdash;"It is a mistake," quoth <i>The World</i>
    last week, "to suppose that Mr. GLADSTONE complacently regards
    Sir WILLIAM HARCOURT as his '<i>Alter Ego</i>.'" Mr. G. being
    the "<i>Ego</i>" it is not very likely that Sir WILLIAM V.
    HARCOURT is likely to "alter" any of his Leader's plans. Still
    an "<i>Alter Ego</i>" is very useful whenever Mr. GLADSTONE may
    want to "wink The Other I."</p>

    with British Force. If hit with stones, try arnica. Rather
    think Timbuctoo was discovered by an Irishman, and called after
    him, TIM BUCKTOO. Eh?</p>

        <i>British Envoy to Foreign Minister.</i>

    <p>Please don't jest; especially not in Irish. Glad to say
    aspect of affairs completely changed. Sultan frightened about
    the stone-throwing. Beheaded Grand Vizier, and sent Lord
    Chamberlain, heavily ironed, to be imprisoned in cellar under
    my own apartment. Gratifying. Treaty on point of being
    signed.</p>

    <center>
        <i>Foreign Minister to British Envoy.</i>
    </center>

    <p>Your action quite approved of. Get Treaty signed quick!
    France, not unnaturally, seems rather galled. See joke? Play on
    word "Gaul."</p>

    <center>
        <i>British Envoy to Foreign Minister.</i>
    </center>

    <p>Quite see joke. Saw it years ago. Please don't send any more
    of 'em. Treaty settled! Gives absurdly generous bounty to all
    British subjects trading with Timbuctoo. Abolishes all Tariffs.
    Draft, with Sultan's signature, returned to him to be properly
    copied out. Mere formality. Packing up, and off to Coast
    to-night.</p>

    <center>
        <i>Same to Same.</i>
    </center>

    <p>Arrived at coast. Treaty in carpet-bag. Regret to say, that
    on examining it, find that Sultan has slipped in the little
    word "not" in every clause. Makes hash of whole thing. What
    shall I do?</p>

    <center>
        <i>Foreign Minister, London, to British Envoy.</i>
    </center>

    <p>Do nothing! Former Foreign Minister no longer in Office.
    General Election <i>has</i> taken place. Whole subject will be
    reconsidered, with quite new lights, before long. Off for a
    holiday just now, and can't attend to it. You'll hear from me
    again in about six months. Meanwhile, your motto must
    be&mdash;"<i>Fez-tina lente</i>!" Last joke. Brilliant. Just
    going to let it off at dinner-party. P.S.&mdash;Great
    success.</p>

    <p>REEF-LECTION.&mdash;Delivering judgment in the case of
    <i>Osborne</i> v. <i>Aaron's Reef, Limited</i>, Mr. Justice
    CHITTY, in the interests of the public, was justly severe on
    both plaintiff and defendants, declining "to give any costs in
    this action to such a Company." Everyone is familiar with the
    nautical expression of "taking in a reef," which seems to have
    been a slightly difficult operation for anyone to perform with
    AARON's Reef, which, after the manner of AARON's Rod, when it
    was transformed into a serpent, appears to possess the faculty
    of swallowing to a very considerable extent. Knowing brokers,
    if consulted, would not have sung to unwary clients the popular
    ditty "<i>Keep your Aarons</i>," but would have recommended
    them, being in, to be out again in double-quick time, if there
    were any chance of an immediate though small ready-money profit
    to be made, before one could have said "Scissors!"</p>

    <h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

    <p>One of the Baron's "Merry Men All" has been reading and
    enjoying Mr. BARRY PAIN's <i>Stories and Interludes</i>. The
    book has a wondrously weird and heavily-lined picture in front,
    which is just a little too like a "Prophetic Hieroglyphic" in
    <i>Zadkiel's Almanack</i>. An emaciated and broken-winged devil
    is apparently carrying an engine-hose through a churchyard,
    whilst a bat flits against a curious sky, which looks like a
    young grainer's first attempt at imitating "birds'-eye maple."
    Upon a second glance it seems possible that the "hose" is a
    snake, the tail of which the devil is gnawing. The gruesome
    design illustrates a yet more gruesome Interlude, entitled,
    "<i>The Bat and the Devil.</i>" But it gives no fair idea of
    the contents of the volume, some of which are charming.</p>

    <p>Read <i>White Nights</i>, stories within a story, told by a
    tragical "Fool," of the breed of HUGO's <i>Rigoletto</i>, and
    POE's <i>Hopfrog</i>&mdash;with a difference. They are told
    with force and grace, and with unstrained, but moving pathos.
    Read "The Dog That Got Found," a brief sketch indeed, but
    abundantly suggestive. Poor <i>Fido</i>&mdash;the "dog that got
    to be utterly sick of conventionality," and came to such bitter
    grief in his search for "life poignant and intense!" He might
    read a lesson to many a two-legged prig, were the bipedal
    nincompoop capable of learning it.</p>

    <p><i>The Glass of Supreme Moments</i> is, perhaps, needlessly
    enigmatical, and <i>Rural Simplicity</i>, <i>Concealed Art</i>,
    and <i>Two Poets</i>, strike one as superfluously "unpleasant."
    Mr. PAIN seems slightly touched with the current literary fad
    for making bricks with the smallest possible quantity of straw.
    One halfpennyworth of the bread of incident to an intolerable
    deal of the sack of strained style and pessimist commentary,
    make poorish imaginative pabulum, though there seems an
    increasing appetite for it amongst those who, unlike <i>Lucas
    Morne</i> in <i>The Glass of Supreme Moments</i>, plume
    themselves upon possession of "the finer perceptions." <i>The
    Magic Morning</i> is a "scrap" elaborately sauced and
    garnished; the fleeting flavour may possess a certain sub-acid
    piquancy, but such small dishes of broken meats are hardly
    nourishing or wholesome.</p>

    <p>Mr. PAIN has a delicate fancy and a graceful style, a
    bitter-sweet humour, and a plentiful endowment of "the finer
    perceptions." He has done some good work here, and will do
    better&mdash;when he finds his subject, and loses his
    affectations. Read <i>White Nights</i>, again says the Baron's
    "retainer."</p>

    <h2>READING THE STARS À LA MODE.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>Extract from the Note-book of the Secretary of the
    Earth and Mars Intercommunication Company, Limited.</i>)</h4>

    <p><i>August</i> 10, 1899.&mdash;Open this book just to jot
    down briefly the results of our efforts to hold a conversation
    with the people living in the adjacent planet. Get a better
    notion by this means of what we are doing than the minutes can
    afford. Shall leave this book as an heirloom to my successors
    in office. In 1892, when we were last nearest Mars (only at a
    distance of 35,000,000 miles or thereabouts), we came to the
    conclusion that the Marsians were trying to speak to us. They
    seemed to be making signals. With the assistance of our new
    telescope (six times as powerful as that of seven years ago),
    we made out what we took to be at first an old man waving a
    white hat. On more careful inspection, found that the old man
    was a volcano in a state of eruption. White hat evidently the
    smoke. Could distinctly locate the ocean. Unable to discover
    more, as the planet went off for another seven years'
    cruise.</p>

    <p><i>August</i> 10, 1906.&mdash;Jot down, in compliance with
    the wishes of my predecessor, the transactions of the Company.
    By the way, my new berth is a very pleasant one. Have nothing
    to do except every seven years, when we all have to watch Mars
    like anything. This time we have a first-class telescope. Fifty
    times as powerful as the one of seven years ago. Can count the
    hairs on a man's head at ten miles' distance. Mars seems quite
    close to us. There is a first-class hotel on one of the
    mountains, and apparently a very good paper, which by the way
    (like everything else on the planet), is red. Distinctly made
    out a man in a boat. Could not attract his attention. Stupid
    donkey! Have to wait for another seven years.</p>

    <p><i>August</i> 10, 1913.&mdash;Again ready. Better telescope
    than one in use seven years ago. Find we can now read the
    Marsian newspapers. They are written in same language as our
    own. Nothing in them worth quoting. Evidently "silly season"
    over there as well as here. Account of the Sea Serpent. Let off
    patent sky-shattering rockets, but the inhabitants of the
    adjacent planet failed to observe them. They have arranged
    bonfires in geometrical order, so far as we can understand it,
    as a signal (if it is one); they seem to wish to observe
    something like "<i>Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay</i>." Interesting.
    Popular song of fourteen years ago just reached our nearest
    neighbour in the Solar System. Cannot observe more, as the
    planet is off for another seven years.</p>

    <p><i>August</i> 10, 1920.&mdash;We ought to do something this
    time. Improved telescope; can see everything. So excellent that
    we can almost hear the Marsians talking, Great advance, too, in
    through-space-hurling machinery. We applied this new power to a
    pea-shooter, and, at the first shot, was sufficiently fortunate
    to hit a Marsian policeman on the nose. He first arrested an
    innocent person for the assault, but, on our repeating the
    signal, he looked up, and shook his fist at the Earth.
    Eventually he traced the source of the pea-shooting. They then
    began to watch our signals. They were just about to reply when
    we started off for another seven years.</p>

    <p><i>August</i> 10, 1927.&mdash;I take up my predecessor's
    book to continue these observations. Deeply interested to see
    if the inhabitants of the neighbouring planet would remember
    the date, and be on the look out for us. Yes, there they were.
    We have just signalled "How are you?" But it has received, as
    yet, no reply. The Marsians seem to be signalling, but not in
    our direction. We have just tried another message, "Good
    morning; do you use soap?" Ah, this has woke them up! They
    <i>do</i> understand us. They have replied, "Don't be rude." We
    are greatly encouraged by this, and have signalled "The planet
    Mars, we believe?" This has elicited no response. Strange! We
    have begged for a reply, and it has just come. Here it
    is:&mdash;"Don't bother; can't attend to you just now. We are
    talking with the planet Jupiter." Time up! Off for another
    seven years!</p>

    <p><i>August</i> 10, 1934.&mdash;Just one line to add to the
    other communications of my predecessors. The Earth and Mars
    Intercommunication Company, Limited, has been merged into the
    London, Jupiter, Venus, Mars, and North Saturn Aërial Railway
    Company. During the present near approach of Mars to the Earth,
    an excursion electric air-torpedo train will leave the Victoria
    Station for Pars the Capital of Mars. The excursion will be
    personally conducted by Baron COOK of Ludgate Circus. Return
    tickets, Second Class, £1,000; First Class (with hotel
    coupons), Half an ounce of coal.</p>

    <h2>HOW IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SETTLED.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>Supplementary and Imaginary Despatch not yet received
    at the Foreign Office.</i>)</h4>

    <p>It will be remembered that I had the honour to report that
    amongst my <i>suite</i> I had the pleasure to be accompanied by
    Herr VON POPOFF, the celebrated Germano-Russian
    <i>prestidigitateur</i>. When I received a despatch from the
    Foreign Office informing me that I was premature in destroying
    the Draft Treaty, although that Draft Treaty contained
    provisions that were entirely different to those which the
    Sultan had already at the time accepted and promised to sign, I
    made up my mind to return to His Sheriffian Majesty with a view
    to setting things right. I considered it advisable to be
    accompanied by Herr VON POPOFF, as I counted upon that eminent
    conjuror's valuable aid to assist me in carrying out what I
    venture to submit, was my praiseworthy object.</p>

    <p>When we reached the room the Sultan was occupying, we found
    His Sheriffian Majesty regarding with some indignation, the
    remains of the Draft Treaty that had been brought back to him
    by the messengers the Sultan had sent to me.</p>

    <p>His Majesty was very angry, and had given orders for the
    immediate execution of Herr VON POPOFF and myself, when my
    talented assistant gently placed his hand upon the head of the
    swarthy and irate Sovereign, and by a clever pass produced an
    egg. This amused and amazed the Sultan immensely, and his
    Sheriffian Majesty desired that the feat should be repeated.
    This request received immediate practical acquiescence as the
    wonderworker deliberately extracted eggs from the Sultan's
    arms, legs, and whiskers. Having obtained some dozen eggs by
    this means, Herr VON POPOFF borrowed a turban from the Prime
    Minister, and breaking the eggs into his improvised saucepan,
    mixed the mess into a compact mass with the assistance of a
    scimitar kindly lent for the occasion by the
    Commander-in-Chief.</p>

    <p>"High cock-alorum jig, jig, jig!" exclaimed the Wizard, and
    in a trice, the eggs had disappeared, and in their place
    appeared a pound-cake. I have the honour to report that the
    cake was then cut into small portions and passed round for
    consumption. His Sheriffian Majesty was good enough to partake
    of the rather stale comestible. The remainder of the cake was
    devoured by the <i>suite</i>.</p>

    <p>By this time the Sultan was in great good humour, when
    unfortunately his eyes fell upon the remains of the destroyed
    Draft Treaty which were still lying unheeded on the palace
    floor. Seeing them his Sheriffian Majesty rolled his eyes
    savagely, and sent for the Lord High Executioner.</p>

    <p>It was at this crisis that Herr VON POPOFF showed great
    presence of mind and absolute coolness. Without a moment's
    hesitation he requested that the fragments of paper might be
    given to him. Taking them in his right hand, he placed them in
    the turban he had previously used for manufacturing his
    pound-cake, and once more repeated his magic formula.</p>

    <p>To the general surprise (and I must not omit my own
    individuality from the universal astonishment) he produced a
    new Treaty, which I then had the honour of handing to the
    Sultan for signature.</p>

    <p>The Treaty (which was subsequently discovered to contain
    several important concessions to the country I have the honour
    to represent) was then signed, and the <i>prestidigitateur</i>
    and I retired loaded with honours.</p>

    <p>I have, in conclusion, to beg permission to wear the
    Sheriffian Order of the Diamond-eyed Pig of the Second Class.
    The Sun-Star of the Emerald Life-sized White Elephant of the
    Double First-Class has already been accepted by Herr VON
    POPOFF, as that gentleman, being a foreign subject, has no need
    to desire official authorisation to use his recently-acquired
    and extremely bulky decoration.</p>

    <p>SIR,&mdash;So many punning Epitaphs have recently appeared

    good; but the then Editor said, "No&mdash;it is unseemly to

    old maxim of "<i>Nil nisi bonum</i>," I beg you will produce

    light and leading article, our "G.A.S." asks "Is Woman a
    Pariah?" Of course she is not, we reply, not even if she be the
    very masculinest of females. Some, if they are "Riahs" at all,
    are "Ma-riahs." "Riah," it may be remembered, is the
    abbreviated form of the name as in the once popular Coster's
    song of "<i>What cheer Riah?</i>" Whether spelt with or without
    an "h" is of no consequence, the Coster not being
    particular.</p>

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <h3 class="sc">Extracted from the Diary of Toby, M.P.</h3>

    <p><i>House of Commons, Monday, Aug</i>. 8.&mdash;Think I
    mentioned, just before Prorogation, how DUNBAR BARTON, offended
    at disregard paid to his warnings by Ministers, protested that
    he would never speak again, and should thenceforth be known as
    DUM BARTON. Finding him to-night figged out, prepared to move
    Address, reminded him of the incident.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:20%;">
        <a href="images/82-2.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/82-2.png"
             alt="Asquith, Q.C." /></a>Asquith, Q.C.
    </div>

    <p>"Quite so, TOBY," he said; "you're perfectly right. I never
    did speak again in that House. This is a different thing.
    Besides, I'm not going to make a speech, but to read a
    paper."</p>

    <p>Rather quibbling this; but temptation to accept invitation
    to move Address at opening of new Session understood to be
    irresistible. Believe I'm the only Member who ever begged to be
    excused. W.H. CROSS seconded Address; speech much mystified
    House; remains to this day disputed point whether he meant to
    be funny, or was merely maladroit. Fancy he really meant it.
    GRAND CROSS in Peers' Gallery, looking on with fond affection.
    Life been for him, of late, a troubled sheet of water. His
    counsel about not dissolving Parliament till very last moment,
    over-ruled; consequence is, Government are going out; how India
    is to get on without him, GRAND CROSS really doesn't know.
    Situation not soothed by reprehensible frivolity of Prince
    ARTHUR. Meeting GRAND CROSS just now, moodily crossing
    Corridor, Prince said,&mdash;"Well, we're not the only parties
    changing places. I see, from the newspapers, that the planet
    Mars has already gone into Opposition."</p>

    <p>GRAND CROSS severely shook his head. There are some things
    too sacred for a joke; his leaving the India Office is one.
    Moreover, not free from certain jealousy in the matter. Fact
    is, been, so to speak, "on the joke" himself. Modest merit,
    like murder, will out. No use attempting to burke what is open
    secret. All those funereal jokes in young Cross's
    speech&mdash;his "course of obituary notices" as ASQUITH
    happily put it&mdash;were really GRAND CROSS's. CROSS
    <i>père</i> composed them in the seclusion of Eccle Riggs, and
    made them over to his son.</p>

    <p>"Would never do, WILLIAM HENRY, for a man in my position to
    publicly make a joke. I am not sure how it befits the Junior
    Counsel for England in the Behring Sea Arbitration. But we must
    risk that. There they are," he said, handing him a packet of
    manuscript in a black-edged envelope, "and may a father's
    blessing accompany them."</p>

    <p>There was, as I have said, some hesitation on part of House
    as to how they were to be received. On the whole, went off
    well. The reference to "the Government, at whose last hours we
    have now arrived," and the proposal to write their epitaph,
    brought down the House. GRAND CROSS sitting in Gallery
    nervously watching result, decidedly encouraged. In larger
    leisure of Opposition we shall probably have more of these
    vicarious flashes of latent
    humour.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page83"

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;Address moved, met with Vote of
    No Confidence, submitted by ASQUITH in brilliant speech.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday</i>.&mdash;Imminence of change in Ministry brings
    into prominence and close proximity what is likely to happen in
    Ireland when Home Rule is established. Irish Members of all
    sections on the alert. SAUNDERSON in his war-paint, which
    assumes shape of luminous white waistcoat. Always know, when
    the Colonel puts that on, he means business. Made to-night good
    Derrydown speech punctuated by howls of execration from Irish
    brethren opposite. That is just what Colonel enjoys; moved him
    to higher nights of oratory. His lurid picture of ASQUITH,
    Q.C., "sitting on the lips of Irish volcano," extremely
    effective. Irish Members cruelly and effectually retorted by
    putting up REDMOND JUNIOR to reply. Colonel gallantly smiled,
    but it was a gashly effort. Device evidently effective. REDMOND
    did admirably; nothing could have been better than his grave
    remark, to presumably alarmed House, that, having for seven
    years sat opposite Colonel, he was able to assure them that he
    was "perfectly harmless&mdash;perfectly harmless."</p>

        <a href="images/84-1.png"><img width="100%"

             alt="Honest John Burns." /></a>Honest John Burns.
    </div>

    <p>"Now that," said ASHBOURNE, in London just now winding up
    his ministerial affairs, "is the cruellest thing I ever heard
    said of SAUNDERSON."</p>

    <p>Later, more serious evidence of seething condition of
    feeling in Ulster brought under notice of House. Ross, Q.C.,
    was returned at General Election, in place of CHARLES
    LEWIS&mdash;a character useful as a study for young Members,
    showing how a man of considerable ability, and distinct
    Parliamentary aptitude, may prove a hopeless failure. Ross born
    and brought up in Derry; accustomed to controversial practices.
    Familiar from boyhood with the concrete form dialectics are apt
    to take when indulged in beyond space of half an hour. "If they
    mean business," Ross said confidentially to Honest JOHN BURNS,
    "they'll find the Derry Boy in it."</p>

    <p>So, before coming down to House, he carefully filled his
    trouser-pocket with convenient-sized paving-stones. When he got
    up just now, House stared with amazement at curious appearance
    presented by the Orator. Ross, pleased with attention created,
    threw back his coat, placed hands on hips, stiffened his legs,
    and made the most of the paving-stones. Members opposite
    whispered, and tittered.</p>

    <p>"Let them laugh that win," said Ross. "In case of a row, a
    paving-stone in trouser-pocket is worth a Krupp's Battery in
    the bush."</p>

    <p>So it proved. Prevention better than cure. Nobody threw
    anything at New Member for Derry, and, when he had concluded
    successful Maiden Speech, went out and emptied his amazing
    pockets into his locker.</p>

    <p>"I'll save 'em up for a rainy day, as the man said when he
    pawned his landlord's umbrella," was Mr. Ross's remark as he
    hurried off home, at least a quarter of a hundredweight
    lighter.</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;More debate on Address.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday</i>.&mdash;Splendid House; full from floor to
    topmost tier of seats in Strangers' Galleries. The last scene
    in history of Government. All the Actors on. Boxes full; Stalls
    full; Pit full. Contrary to LORD CHAMBERLAIN's regulations,
    chairs placed in gangways. Great rush for these, as affording
    novel position. MATHERS, who got front seat, says it was very
    nice, but not without compensating disadvantage. "Expected
    every minute, you know, the man coming round for your penny, as
    they do in the Parks."</p>

    <p>CHAMBERLAIN had first call; greatly cheered by Conservatives
    when he stood before footlights. Little bit of farce to begin
    with. ALPHEUS CLEOPHAS rose with JOSEPH. Submitted as point of
    order that, in Moving Adjournment on Tuesday night, JOSEPH had
    exhausted his right to speak. House howled. Just as if, Lyceum
    crowded to see IRVING play <i>Charles the First</i>, JOHNNIE
    TOOLE came before Curtain and explained that, as CHARLES THE
    FIRST was indubitably beheaded some hundreds of years ago,
    IRVING would be out of order in appearing to-night. Very well
    done, and added something to interest of moment. But
    unnecessary. JOSEPH equal to occasion without adventitious
    aid.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:22%;">
        <a href="images/84-2.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/84-2.png"
             alt="Don't Keir-Hardie, M.P. for 'Am." /></a>Don't
             Keir-Hardie, M.P. for 'Am.
    </div>

    <p>A fine speech, equal to the magnificent audience. Even DON'T
    KEIR-HARDIE took off his cap to listen. JOSEPH never better
    with his quick sharp thrust, his lunging blow, and his apt
    tripping up. As usual, best where speech broken in upon with
    rude interruption. Note the incident when launched upon his
    peroration, carefully prepared and perilously adventured upon.
    House not passionately fond of perorations. Will suffer them
    only from Mr. G. and one or two others. CHAMBERLAIN rarely
    rises to peroration point. To-night a great occasion. Solemn
    enough even for peroration. Rising with its swelling tide, he
    came to ask "the wisest and the most sensible among you to
    consider the situation." Standing at the moment with face
    turned to Liberals above Gangway; from Irish camp behind his
    back rose shouts of ironical cheers and noisy laughter,
    "Boo-oo!" CHAMBERLAIN stopped perforce, and with scornful
    gesture of thumb over his shoulder at mob behind, said, "Yes,
    to the others I do not speak;" then went on and finished his
    sentence.</p>

    <p>"A great day this, for JOSEPH," I said after, to SQUIRE OF
    MALWOOD.</p>

    <p>"Ah," said. THE PERSONAGE, meditatively stroking a chin made
    for Cabinets. "Yes, he's very important; he reminds me of a
    story I heard when I was in Scotland. There was a funeral going
    on in a quiet street in Glasgow. Among the company present was
    observed a man whom nobody seemed to know, but who was bustling
    about as if he were in charge of most things. At last the
    undertaker, jealous of his own position, suggested he had
    better take a back seat. 'Losh man!' cried the Unknown, his
    eyes blazing with indignation, 'I'm brither to the corpp.'
    Dissentient Liberalism is dead; but JOE is brither to the
    corpp, and we must bear with him a little."</p>

    <p>That's all very well; but they haven't done with JOSEPH yet.
    There may come times of distress and famine when he will be
    heard of from Egypt.</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;The Government's. Wound up by a
    majority of 40 in turbulent House of 660 Members.</p>

Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
